<p>Hi, I'm Rob Watts ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>You've found yourself on my personal site. This is where I keep public notes and blog posts.</p>
<p>Here's a page on my background if you want to know more about me.</p>
<p>Some posts contain pearls of wisdom I learned from some great people I have been lucky enough to know and work with.  I always cite the original author when I knowingly do this. But please [[Contact]] me if you see something that's yours!</p>
<p>I'm learning all the time. The contents in any post may well have changed in my mind since I wrote it. I might go back and update but I probably won't. Being wrong or misinformed at some point in time should be a given. The only person I aim to please on the internet is myself.</p>
<p>I write using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> and appreciate the community who have inspired me enough to create my own detailed notes and every so often publish one of them here.</p>
<h2 id="wonderbly" tabindex="-1"><a href="#wonderbly" class="header-anchor">Wonderbly</a></h2>
<p>I am CTO at <a href="https://www.wonderbly.com/">Wonderbly</a>.</p>
