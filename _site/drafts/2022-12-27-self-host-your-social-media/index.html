<p>If the Musk takeover of Twitter has been good for one thing, it's encouraged many people to move to Mastodon.</p>
<p>From almost every perspective, Mastodon is unquestionably a better solution for social media than a centralised authority such as Twitter.</p>
<p>What's important to me is that as a user on a trusted instance, I know I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose an instance that has rules to suit me and users to suit my interests</li>
<li>Migrate my account to another instance (although posts cannot move)</li>
<li>Export my data (toots, follows, lists, followers, blocks etc)</li>
<li>Delete my account from an instance</li>
</ul>
<p>With the open, community run protocols governing Fediverse/ActivityPub, there is plurality of choice for users. Choosing to live on server A does not cut you off from server B. If Server A runs a better instance then users will choose to flock there. People can build apps on top that support all servers.</p>
<p>This is great and clearly serves a need very well.</p>
<p>However, there is a niche user base that want a greater degree of ownership of anything that is posted in their name to internet. Of course, the internet and its protocols is an infinite layer cake, and you could you argue that can never exclusively "own" the data that passes through it. But let's leave that one for another day.</p>

<p>Just want to say this upfront: I do not want to put people off Mastodon or the communities who diligently run so many great instances. There's great things happening in this space and they are going to be awesome for most people. My current favourite is <a href="https://home.omg.lol">the awesome omg.lol suite of services by Beatnik</a>. All this post is doing is exploring alternatives for a niche audience of people</p>
<p>But whatever the good intentions of the owners of the instances there are issues that may niggle away you. Most people don't worry about this stuff, and for lots of things on the internet neither do I. But social media is part of your online identity, so it's worth thinking about:</p>
<h3 id="be-in-control-of-your-own-data" tabindex="-1"><a href="#be-in-control-of-your-own-data" class="header-anchor">Be in control of your own data</a></h3>
<p>Yes you have a lot more control than you used to on Twitter but at the end of the day it's someone else's server. On that server resides a lot of your personal data, some of which private. That server could be compromised in an attack or the owners could use it in ways you don't expect.</p>
<p>From this perspective, btw, the centralised Twitter model is actually better. They have well paid security teams looking after your data, governed by global data protection agreements and are scared enough by the fines to follow them. Lastly they are regulated SEC, at least until Musk takes them off the market.</p>
