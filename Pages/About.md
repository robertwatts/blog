# About

Hi, I'm Rob Watts ðŸ‘‹

You've found yourself on my personal site. This is where I keep public notes and blog posts. 

Here's a page on my background if you want to know more about me. 

Some posts contain pearls of wisdom I learned from some great people I have been lucky enough to know and work with.  I always cite the original author when I knowingly do this. But please [[Contact me]] if you see something that's yours!

I'm learning all the time. The contents in any post may well have changed in my mind since I wrote it. I might go back and update but I probably won't. Being wrong or misinformed at some point in time should be a given. The only person I aim to please on the internet is myself.

I write using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and appreciate the community who have inspired me enough to create my own detailed notes and every so often publish one of them here.

## Wonderbly
For my day job I am CTO of [Wonderbly](https://www.wonderbly.com/). 

I run the business with my co-execs under the CEO.  I manage the software development teams inside Wonderbly.  I am forever improving the machine we have built to bring our amazingly personalised products to ever more people.
