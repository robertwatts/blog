I still have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/rwatts_), but I try not to doom scroll in it very much. I'm generally not a fan of social media platforms like Twitter, Insta, FB etc so if you find an account of mine I haven't got round to deleting please don't be surprised to receive no reply. 

In case you're interested, I wrote a note about this in my review of the very excellent [[10 Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now (Jaron Lanier)]].
