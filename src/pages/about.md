Hi, I'm Rob Watts ðŸ‘‹

You've found yourself on my personal site. This is where I keep public notes and blog posts.

Here's a page on my background if you want to know more about me.

Some posts contain pearls of wisdom I learned from some great people I have been lucky enough to know and work with. I always cite the original author when I knowingly do this. But please contact me if you see something that's yours!

I'm learning all the time. The contents in any post may well have changed in my mind since I wrote it. I _might_ go back and update but I probably won't. Being wrong or misinformed at some point in time should be a given. The only person I aim to please on the internet is myself.

## This site
This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) using a modified version of the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme. I'm a big fan of both.

## Wonderbly
CTO at [Wonderbly](https://www.wonderbly.com/). I love what we do and the people we do it with.

I run the business with my other execs. I am responsible for the techology organisation and guide the product-led squads. We are forever improving the curious mix of creative and technology that brings our amazingly personalised products to life.

I love working here. [You might too](https://wonderbly.jobs.personio.com).
